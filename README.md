#Weather Checker App - React

This is a basic weather checking using states to check a persons local weather using weatherapi.json. A user inputs their 
location and hits search. With this, it returns their local weather in both Celsius and Farenheit. It also appends a body 
class currently which will be able to distinguish weather it is currently night or day at a persons given location.
